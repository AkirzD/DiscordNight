# DiscordNight

Requires [Discord](https://discordapp.com/) desktop app with [BetterDiscord](https://betterdiscord.net/home/) addon installed.

1. Download DiscordNight.theme.css and place the file in %appdata%/BetterDiscord/themes
2. Refresh Discord using (CTRL+R) or restart Discord
3. Go to Settings > BetterDiscord > Themes and enable DiscordNight

Make sure you have **Dark Theme** enabled in Settings > Appearance > Theme and select Dark  
      Having **BetterDiscord Blue** enabled is recommended but not necessary for the theme to work correctly for the most part.  
	  BetterDiscord Blue is enabled in Settings > BetterDiscord Core > BetterDiscord Blue.  

Keep in mind that things may break at any time because of Discords background updates.
